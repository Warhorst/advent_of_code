## Puzzle Solution Categories
### Introduction
A (WIP) listing of the puzzles and the techniques / technologies used to solve them. This should help me find similar
solutions to former puzzles, which might help to solver newer ones faster.

- text parsing
- (complex) pattern matching
- Iterator Operations

A '-' means a puzzle did not require special techniques to be solved
